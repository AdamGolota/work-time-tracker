# work-time-tracker
Yeah, it was created by chatgpt in 30 seconds by the following prompt:
```
Write me a web page with following features:
1) stopwatch with start/pause/reset buttons
2) a list of datetimes when any of those buttons were hit (specify which one)
3) store the list and stopwatch state in local storage

This page will be used as work time tracker.
```
